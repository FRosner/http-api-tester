# HTTP API Tester

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FRosner/http-api-tester.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FRosner/http-api-tester)

## Description

This is a framework for testing HTTP APIs. It let's you define your test suites and test cases in form of a simple folder structure or a generic run script.

## Usage

### Example

The HTTP API Tester project comes with an example test suite.
If you want the tests to pass, you need to serve the directory through an HTTP server.
Otherwise you can skip this step and see what failing tests look like.

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:FRosner/http-api-tester.git
cd http-api-tester.git

# Start an HTTP server inside the git repo folder
# This requires http-server to be installed (npm install http-server -g)
# You can skip it if you want (but the tests will fail)
http-server&

# See Usage
./http-api-tester --help

# Run example test suite
./http-api-tester example-suite

# Shut down http-server again: kill %$(jobs | grep http-server | grep -Po '\d+')
```

### Writing Tests

HTTP API Tester uses a simple directory structure to define tests.
When invoked, you specify the suite to run.
A test suite consist of one or multiple test cases.
Each test case corresponds to one HTTP request being sent.
The test case can be configured using the following parameters.
Parameters printed in _italic_ are mandatory.
All scripts will be executed with bash at the moment.

- _Test case name (directory name)_
  - HTTP method (defaults to `GET`)
  - URL (defaults to `localhost:80`)
  - Request data
  - Request header (one header per line)
  - Curl options (such as --insecure)
  - Before script (bash or executable)
  - Run script (executable)
  - After script (bash or executable)
  - Expectations
    - HTTP status
    - Response data (JSON or executable)
- Before all script (bash or executable)
- After all script (bash or executable)
- Before each script (bash or executable)
- After each script (bash or executable)

The example suite has the following directory structure:

```
example-suite
├── correct-json-content
│   ├── expected
│   │   ├── http-status
│   │   ├── response-data
│   ├── method
│   ├── request-data
│   ├── curl-options
│   ├── request-header
│   └── url
├── generic-test
│   └── run
├── index-reachable
│   ├── before
│   ├── after
│   ├── expected
│   │   └── http-status
│   ├── method
│   ├── request-data
│   └── url
├── before-all
├── after-all
├── before-each
└── after-each
```

If there is an executable `run` script, it will be executed instead of the specified HTTP requests.

### Test Results

Each test run is persisted in a subfolder called `run-%Y-%m-%d-%k-%M-%S`.
It allows you to debug or save your test results for later.

```
test-suite/test-case
├── run-2016-07-15-17-03-12
│   └── ...
└── run-2016-07-16-15-00-35
    └── ...
```

If you execute a lot of tests, the results will pile up. In order to only save the latest test result, you can use the `-c` or `--clean` argument.

```
./http-api-tester -c example-suite
```

### Executing Specific Tests

In case you want to launch a only selected tests, you can use the `-g` or `--grep` option.
It allows to you select the test cases to run based on a regular expression which is applied to the test case name.
This might be useful for debugging or executing only parts of your longer running suite.

If, for example, you want to run only your UI tests ending with `ui`, you can accomplish this by executing

```sh
./http-api-tester -g ".*ui$" example-suite
```

### Comparing with greater-or-equal

This option was introduced to cope with changing (growing) timestamps that may be part of your json answer. 
```sh
./http-api-tester -o ge example-suite-ge/
```

## Installation

Make sure to have your test suites ready in your project directory and the requirements set up. To run the tool, just execute:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FRosner/http-api-tester/master/http-api-tester) example-suite
```

## Requirements
- curl 7.43.0
- jq-1.5 (for JSON payload)
- cmp (GNU diffutils) 2.8.1
- diff (GNU diffutils) 2.8.1
